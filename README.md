This project is about defining 3 main coral processes (i.e. calcification rate, net photosynthesis rate, and respiration rate) of six prominent reef-building coral taxa in Mo'orea (french Polynesia).
The whole code is available, allowing to get the raw figures. For aesthetic reasons, raw figures were finalised with Adobe Illustrator 2019. 

The data could be find in the data folder.
The script used for the manuscript figures could be find in the R_Scripts folder as [Coral_Physiology.R](https://github.com/JayCrlt/Coral_Physiology/tree/master/R_Scripts).
The second script is about the supplementary analysis.

J.C, H.R, D.B and V.P conceived the idea and methods. J.C, A.M, B.E and U.C performed the incubation experiments. J.C. performed the photogrammetry. J.C. created the metabolic model and D.B improved the R Script. J.C wrote the first draft of the paper, and all co-authors contributed to revisions and approved the final draft
